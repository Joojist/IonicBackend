# Express.js Backend

This repository contains a basic Express.js backend, designed to work with an Angular/Ionic frontend. It provides a simple REST API for fetching and posting data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd <repository_name>
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Backend

To start the Express.js server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` environment variable before starting the server.

## Endpoints

This backend provides a few basic endpoints to interact with the Angular/Ionic frontend.

### GET /hello

Returns a simple welcome message.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/hello
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from Express.js!"
}
```

### POST /send

Accepts a JSON payload and returns a simple response.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello backend!"}' http://localhost:3000/send
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Received: Hello backend!"
}
```

## Structure

- `index.js`: The main entry point for the Express.js backend.
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts.

### Additional Notes

- This backend is a simple example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would likely need additional middleware, error handling, and security features.
- Ensure your frontend (e.g., Angular/Ionic) correctly points to the backend endpoints.
- For secure deployments, consider using environment variables for sensitive information and add appropriate security measures like HTTPS, CORS, and input validation.
